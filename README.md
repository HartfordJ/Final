## A Little Backstory...

Once in a blue moon, under the arc of a double rainbow, you might find yourself blessed with a perfectly formatted .csv file. However, you awake from your dream and remember that many files are in fact compiled and formatted in ways that make you question your sanity. Thus, you begin your search for a rational way to read and manipulate the files to fit your needs.

For my project, the .csv files that were in need of some TLC were collections of spring data collected over a large temporal and spatial scale. The files were initially unreadable because of the format of the title and the header, which were improperly spaced and did not correlate to each column of data. Due to the nature of the location and time of the data collections, differences in column names and values became a significant problem to overcome. For instance, some files listed the data collection time in GMT-04:00, while others listed it in GMT-05:00. Some files included the range of the spring, while other files omitted this info and thus had fewer columns. Additionally, all of the files grouped 'Date' and 'Time' into the same column, so I took it upon myself to separate them into two distinct columns. Lastly, I appended multiple files from the same sample location into a sinlge, comprehensive file.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for access to the code, files, and outputs.

From my 'Final' repository in github, we want to select 'Clone' to download a ZIP of my repository. Save this file to whatever directory your heart desires. Unzip the folder, then enter RStudio and use the command `setwd("Final-working")` to make this folder the working directory. Please note that the .csv files must remain inside of the folder titled 'CSV' that is located in the working directory along with 'FunctionSpr.R'. Then,---------------- 

### Prerequisites

Within RStudio, run the following code to set stringsAsFactors to false, install and load the tidyverse (a collection of packages for data manipulation), and to set the CSV folder containing the .csv files as the path that will be used within the function. 
```
options(stringsAsFactors = F)
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
path <- "CSV"
```

## Running the Code

To utilize the function that manipulates the files, we must first run the entire function within the console of RStudio in order to asign it our desired name. This allows us to later call upon this function by simply typing the name we have assigned it. To do this, open the 'FunctionSpr.R' file in RStudio. Select the entire function and run it, making sure that the name "SpringDat.R" has shown up in the _Functions_ portion of the R _Environment_ in the upper right-hand corner. For convenience, the function within 'FunctionSpr.R' is also listed below. 

```
SpringDat.R <- function(path) {
  glob.path <- paste0(path, "/*", ".csv")
  dataFiles <- lapply(Sys.glob(glob.path), read.csv, skip=1, header=T)
  datepat <- "\\d{2}\\/\\d{2}\\/\\d{2}"
  timepat <- "\\d{2}\\:\\d{2}\\:\\d{2} [AP]M"
  GMTpat <- "\\d{2}.\\d{2}"
  Temppat <- "Temp\\.{3}[FC]"
  for (i in 1:length(dataFiles)){
    DTCol <- dataFiles[[i]][, grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
    dataFiles[[i]]$Date <- str_extract(DTCol,datepat)
    dataFiles[[i]]$Time <- str_extract(DTCol,timepat)
    GMTval <- str_extract(names(dataFiles[[i]])[grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))], GMTpat)
    timecol <- paste0("Time, GMT-", substr(GMTval,1,2),":",substr(GMTval,4,5))
    names(dataFiles[[i]])[names(dataFiles[[i]])=="Time"] <- timecol
    dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]][, !grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
    tempcolname <- names(dataFiles[[i]])[grepl("Temp", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
    Fextrc <- str_extract(tempcolname, Temppat)
    is_F <- substr(Fextrc, nchar(Fextrc),nchar(Fextrc))=="F"
    if (is_F) {
      dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]] %>% 
        mutate(convert=(!!as.name(tempcolname) - 32) * 5/9 )
      Cextrc <- str_replace(Fextrc,"F","C")
      newcolname <- str_replace(tempcolname, Fextrc, Cextrc)
      dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]][, !grepl("Temp", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
      names(dataFiles[[i]])[names(dataFiles[[i]])=="convert"] <- newcolname
    }
    dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]] %>% 
      select(!!as.name(names(dataFiles[[i]])[1]), Date, !!as.name(timecol), if(is_F)newcolname else tempcolname, everything())
  }
  dir.create("SpringData", showWarnings = F)
  for (i in 1:length(dataFiles)){
    write_csv(dataFiles[[i]], file.path("SpringData", basename(Sys.glob(glob.path)[i])))
  }
}
```

Once the function has been run in rstudio, it can be sourced and applied to numerous files/folders simply by inputting the name of the object of interest. In this case, the folder containing the .csv files is called CSV, so the function is applied to this folder. To achieve this, simply run the code below.
```
source("FunctionSpr.R")
SpringDat.R("CSV")
```
This command will run and edit each file individually, then export it to a newly created folder titled "SpringData" within the working directory. The newly edited files that are from the same sample location (with the same unit serial number) will be consolidated into one large .csv file that lists the sample location as their name. This allows different files of the same location to be grouped together for easier file management.

### Breaking it Down

Although I was able to accomplish my tasks in the last section, this section's purpose is to provide explanation about the commands within my function. 
The very first line of code renames the function of the path (in this case the path being = to CSV) to _SpringDat.R_, which can then be called upon from the command line at a later time. The subsequent code allows us to read the _.csv_ files while also skipping over the unnecessary title. Patterns are assigned to names so that they may be called upon at a later time to edit the 'Date.Time' columns.
```
SpringDat.R <- function(path) {
   glob.path <- paste0(path, "/*", ".csv")
   dataFiles <- lapply(Sys.glob(glob.path), read.csv, skip=1, header=T)
   datepat <- "\\d{2}\\/\\d{2}\\/\\d{2}"
   timepat <- "\\d{2}\\:\\d{2}\\:\\d{2} [AP]M"
   GMTpat <- "\\d{2}.\\d{2}"
   Temppat <- "Temp\\.{3}[FC]"
```
The next part of the function utilizes some of the patterns that were previously created to separate the 'Date.Time' column into two separate columns.
```
   for (i in 1:length(dataFiles)){
      DTCol <- dataFiles[[i]][, grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
      dataFiles[[i]]$Date <- str_extract(DTCol,datepat)
      dataFiles[[i]]$Time <- str_extract(DTCol,timepat)
      GMTval <- str_extract(names(dataFiles[[i]])[grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))], GMTpat)
```
The next part of the function creates a new time column with the formatt of _Time GMT-0*:00_.
```
      timecol <- paste0("Time, GMT-", substr(GMTval,1,2),":",substr(GMTval,4,5))
      names(dataFiles[[i]])[names(dataFiles[[i]])=="Time"] <- timecol
```
The next part of the function drops the original _Date.Time_ column, which is uneccessary to keep since separate columns were created for both 'Date' and 'Time'.
```
      dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]][, !grepl("Date.Time", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
```
The next part of the function checks to see if the _Temp_ column is listed in fahrenheit or celcius. If the column name includes 'Â°F', the temp values are converted to celcius and the column name is edited so that 'F' is replaced by 'C'. 
```
      tempcolname <- names(dataFiles[[i]])[grepl("Temp", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
      Fextrc <- str_extract(tempcolname, Temppat)
      is_F <- substr(Fextrc, nchar(Fextrc),nchar(Fextrc))=="F"
      if (is_F) {
        dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]] %>% 
         mutate(convert=(!!as.name(tempcolname) - 32) * 5/9 )
       Cextrc <- str_replace(Fextrc,"F","C")
       newcolname <- str_replace(tempcolname, Fextrc, Cextrc)
       dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]][, !grepl("Temp", names(dataFiles[[i]]))]
       names(dataFiles[[i]])[names(dataFiles[[i]])=="convert"] <- newcolname
      }
      dataFiles[[i]] <- dataFiles[[i]] %>% 
        select(!!as.name(names(dataFiles[[i]])[1]), Date, !!as.name(timecol), if(is_F)newcolname else tempcolname,    everything())
   }
```
The function below creates a new folder named "SpringData" where outputs of each individual file will be sent. As previously mentioned, this step also includes code that consolidates all of the data from a particular sample location into a singular file. 
```
   dir.create("SpringData", showWarnings = F)
      for (i in 1:length(dataFiles)){
       write_csv(dataFiles[[i]], file.path("SpringData", basename(Sys.glob(glob.path)[i])))
   }
}
```
